## Info

A short adventure/escape room type game I made to experiment with Json and adventure game elements. You move and interact with the environment by typing commands into the input field. The story is presented in a visual novel/text adventure type style accompanied with 3d visuals.

## Game overview

The player navigates the scene by typing in commands or pressing 'Enter' to continue when prompted. The room is separated into different nodes that represent a different corner of the room, each node has different items and narration attached to it. When the game registers a move command the camera moves via a NavMesh agent to the referenced node. The game also features simple dialogue choices that the player picks by typing them out.
